===========

**Multi-Agent Accelerator for Data Science: Batch AutoML (MAADSBML)**

*Revolutionizing Data Science with Artificial Intelligence*

**Overview**

MAADSBML combines Artificial Intelligence, Docker, Machine Learning.  It automates the machine learning process, and finds the BEST algorithm for your data.  It also
produces a very detailed PDF report.  MAADSBML is integrated with Docker Container.
 
This library allows users to harness the power of agent-based computing using hundreds of advanced linear and non-linear algorithms. 

**Compatibility**
    - Python 3.8 or greater
    - Minimal Python skills needed

**Copyright**
   - Author: Sebastian Maurice, PhD

**Installation**
   - At the command prompt write:

.. code-block:: console
   
   pip install maadsbml

- This assumes you have [Downloaded Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and installed it on your computer.  
	 - You will also need to pull the MAADSBML Docker container:  **maadsdocker/maads-batch-automl-otics**

**Syntax**
  - There are literally two lines of code you need to write to train your data and make predictions:

**Main functions:**
   - **hypertraining**
     Executes hundreds of agents, running hundreds of advanced algorithms and completes in minutes.  A master agent then chooses the BEST algorithm that best  models your data.
   - **hyperpredictions**
     After training, make high quality predictions - takes less than half a second (about ~100 milliseconds). Users can also generate predictions using **non-python code** 
	 such as JAVA.  	 
   - **algodescription**
     Get detailed information on the optimal algorithm found during hypertraining
   - **abort**
     Abort the training process.
   - **rundemo**
     To run canned demo of the system to see how it works.
	 
**First import the Python library.**

**import maadsbml**

**Parameters:**	

*host* : string, required

- This is the IP address of the running Docker container - it is usually http://localhost

*port* : int, required

- This is the TRAINING PORT in the container. The default is port==5595

*filename* : string, required
 
 - This is the raw data file in csv format - Note this file is stored on your host machine - the DOCKER container needs to be mapped to this volume using -v

*dependentvariable* : string, required

- This is the dependent variable in your csv file.

*removeoutliers* : int, optional, 1 or 0

- If 1, then outliers will be removed from your data.  If 0, no outliers are removed.

*hasseasonality* : int, optional, 1 or 0
      
- If 1, then your data will be modeled for seasonality: Winter, Summer, Shoulder. If 0, then your data will 
  not be modeled for seasonality.  If modeling for seasonality, ensure you have enough data points that 
  covers the seasons, usually 1 year of data.
       
*summer* : string, optional
       
- Definition for summer months.  This can be changed.

*winter* : string, optional
       
- Definition for winter months.  This can be changed.

*shoulder* : string, optional
       
- Definition for shoulder months.  This can be changed.

*trainingpercentage* : int, optional, Default=70
       
- This is the split percentage between Training and Test data sets.   It is defaulted to 70 (70% for training, 30% test).

*shuffle* : number, 0 or 1, optional

- Indicates whether to shuffle the training dataset or not, default=0.

*deepanalysis* : int, optional

- This will force MAADSBML to perform deeper analysis on your data.  This could take 30-40 minutes.  Set to 1 for deepanalysis, 0 for no deep analysis.

*username* : string, optional
 
 - This identifies a user.  You may want to change this if multiple users are running the same file.

*company* : string, optional
 
 - This identifies your company. You may want to change this for the Report.

*timeout* : int, optional

- You can increase this if you receive a timeout error before the training is taking too long. The setting is in seconds.

*password* : string, optional 

 - leave as is

*email* : string, optional 

 - leave as is
 
*usereverseproxy* : int, optional
